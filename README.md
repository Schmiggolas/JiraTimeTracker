# JiraTimeTracker
A little tool to get working hours from your Jira members

## Usage
Open on windows only (no mono since it does not support forms, hence no linux/mac support for now, sorry) 

1. Enter your Jiras URL(:Port), your login username and password

(1.5 Be aware of the fact that I am a noob and have no friggin clue how to handle passwords correctly. I'm not responsible if you use the same password for your paypal or something, just saying...)

2. Enter the persons project key (APRC <- like that. NOT the full name like "Awesome Project, Really Cool) and username (not the display name! if you are not sure get a list via the bottom right button)

3. Press Go!

4. Wait for it (seriously... wait... the querying takes a while)

5. ???

6. Profit
